# Turn Based RPG Project
[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=flat&logo=unity)](https://www.unity.com)

This is a **test project** where I tried to create the basics of a **RPG game** with **overworld**. In this case I wanted to have a **2D pixel art overworld** with **3D battle scenes**.

## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

The player can move in the grid based overworld and start a fight against monster when he goes over a monster tile.

The player can gain experience from killing monsters and learn new abilities to use during the fight

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.20f1 (or greater)

## How to play

In order to play the game you have two options:
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and play it from the game window
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and build it for your platform

The commands are really simple:
* W/A/S/D: Move the player in the overworld
* W/A/S/D: Choose actions in the battle menu
* Enter: Confirm the selected action in the battle menu

## Gameplay example

This is an example that shows you how the game looks like.

A cool feature that I implemented is the AFK camera - when you don't press any key for a certain amount of seconds this will happen:

## Test notes

Well, creating RPG games it's always a pleasure because they are my favorite genre.

I'm pretty satisfied of the project, I tried to make it more scalable as possible and I succeed in doing so. For example I can create as many enemies as I want without chaning anything in the battle scene.

I also made from scratch the battle menu, but to be honest I could have done it in an easier way ahah.

A cool thing that this project gave me is more knowledge on Cinemachines, as you can see from the Gamplay example section, I played with them a little!

Of course, as always, this is a test project, many things can be improved, but the important aspect was to achieve to create the basics of a RPG game - creating a complete RPG game from scratch it requires too much time.
