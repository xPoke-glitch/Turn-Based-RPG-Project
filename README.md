# Turn Based RPG Project
[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=flat&logo=unity)](https://www.unity.com)

This is a **test project** where I tried to create the basics of a **RPG game** with **overworld**. In this case I wanted to have a **2D pixel art overworld** with **3D battle scenes**.

## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

The player can move in the grid based overworld and start a fight against monster when he goes over a monster tile.

The player can gain experience from killing monsters and learn new abilities to use during the fight

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.20f1 (or greater)

## How to play

In order to play the game you have two options:
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and play it from the game window
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and build it for your platform

The commands are really simple:
* W/A/S/D: Move the player in the overworld
* W/A/S/D: Choose actions in the battle menu
* Enter: Confirm the selected action in the battle menu

## Gameplay example

This is an example that shows you how the game looks like.

A cool feature that I implemented is the AFK camera - when you don't press any key for a certain amount of seconds this will happen:
